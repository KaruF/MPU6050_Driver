# MPU6050_Driver
Complete driver for MPU6050 IMU 


Hi everyone,

- It is going to be complete driver for mpu6050 and it won't be for any particular architecture. So you can easly implement it to your hardware!
- You just must write wrapper function to struct MPU6050_COMM_INIT send, receive function pointer. 
- It is not at the end yet but i will update it when it will get some new functions or new feature.

- Probably it won't be included DMP functionality due to lack of documentation.

- At some point, i might publish linux version under this repository.


Keep in touch!
